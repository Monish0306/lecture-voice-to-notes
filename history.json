Concise Lecture Notes\n\n**Project Title:** Wind Energy Feasibility Dashboard\n\n**Developer:** Manish\n\n**Technology Used:** Python, Open Data Database\n\n**Goal:** Analyze wind patterns, energy potential, and urban performance for different locations and years.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **GitHub Repository:** All project code is stored on GitHub.\n*   **Libraries:**  Requires specific Python libraries (details in code).\n*   **Location Input:**  User inputs a location; the dashboard displays latitude and longitude.\n*   **Turbine Power Output:** Displays turbine power output in meters per second.\n*   **Historical Data:**  Presents historical wind data (2022 to past 5 years) with monthly average wind speeds (January to December).\n*   **Problem Statement:** Assess site suitability for wind turbine installation based on wind patterns and financial feasibility.\n\n**Problem being solved:** Assessing site suitability for wind turbine installations (financial & wind feasibility).\n\n## 2. Flashcards (Q&A)\n\n**Flashcard 1:**\n\n*   **Q:** What is the primary purpose of the wind energy feasibility dashboard?\n*   **A:** To analyze wind patterns, energy potential, and urban performance to assess the feasibility of wind turbine installations.\n\n**Flashcard 2:**\n\n*   **Q:** What programming language was used to develop the dashboard?\n*   **A:** Python\n\n**Flashcard 3:**\n\n*   **Q:** What type of data does the dashboard use to provide historical wind information?\n*   **A:** Open Data Database\n\n**Flashcard 4:**\n\n*   **Q:** What key output does the dashboard provide after the user inputs a location?\n*   **A:** Latitude, longitude, turbine power output (m/s), and historical wind data.\n\n**Flashcard 5:**\n\n*   **Q:** Where can the code for the wind energy dashboard be found?\n*   **A:** On a GitHub repository.\n\n## 3. Multiple-Choice Quiz Questions\n\n**Question 1:**\n\nWhat is the main goal of the wind energy feasibility dashboard?\n\n(a) To design new wind turbine models.\n(b) To analyze wind patterns and assess the feasibility of wind turbine installations.\n(c) To predict future weather patterns.\n(d) To create a social media platform for wind energy enthusiasts.\n\n*   **Correct Answer:** (b)\n*   **Hint:** Think about the purpose of assessing \"feasibility.\"\n\n**Question 2:**\n\nWhich programming language was used to create the wind energy feasibility dashboard?\n\n(a) Java\n(b) C++\n(c) Python\n(d) JavaScript\n\n*   **Correct Answer:** (c)\n*   **Hint:** This language is popular for data analysis and scientific computing.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\nWhat type of data does the dashboard utilize to display past wind conditions?\n\n(a) Real-time sensor data\n(b) Simulated weather models\n(c) Open data historical database\n(d) User-submitted wind reports\n\n*   **Correct Answer:** (c)\n*   **Hint:** The dashboard uses already available and free to access data.\n\n**Question 4:**\n\nWhat information is displayed by the dashboard when a location is entered?\n\n(a) Population density of the location\n(b) Latitude and longitude of the location\n(c) Average rainfall in the location\n(d) Local electricity prices\n\n*   **Correct Answer:** (b)\n*   **Hint:**  These are geographical coordinates.\n\n**Question 5:**\n\nWhat is one output from the dashboard that helps determine wind turbine suitability?\n\n(a) Cost of land rental\n(b) Turbine power output in m/s\n(c) Number of birds in the area\n(d) Local zoning regulations\n\n*   **Correct Answer:** (b)\n*   **Hint:** Think about which output would directly indicate the strength of the wind in the area.\n"
